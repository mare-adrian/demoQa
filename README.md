# demoQa
Automated UI tests for the Elements section of DemoQA using Java, Selenium, TestNG and Page Object Model. Covers forms, checkboxes, radio buttons, web tables, buttons, links, file upload/download, dynamic properties and API checks via Chrome DevTools.
✅ DemoQA Elements Automation – Selenium Java Framework

This project contains a complete automation suite for the Elements section of DemoQA, built with a clean, scalable structure using Java + Selenium + TestNG + Page Object Model (POM).
It demonstrates professional testing skills, framework architecture, and real QA Automation workflows.

🚀 Key Skills Demonstrated
✅ Page Object Model (POM) Architecture

Each DemoQA component is separated into its own page class

Improves readability, maintainability, and reusability

Centralized element locators and behavior-specific methods

✅ Selenium WebDriver Automation

Covers all major interaction types:

Typing, clicking, double-click, right-click

Dynamic waits (explicit waits with conditions)

Scrolling with JavaScript

Window/tab switching

Uploading and downloading files

Detecting dynamic states (visible/enabled after delay)

✅ Real Testing Flows Implemented

The suite automates the full Elements module:

✅ Text Box – fill form & assert results

✅ Check Box – expand folders, select items, verify output

✅ Radio Buttons – validate selection

✅ Web Tables – add users dynamically & verify data

✅ Buttons – double click, right click, dynamic click asserts

✅ Links – window handling & URL verification

✅ Broken Links – API call capture using Chrome DevTools

✅ Upload & Download – verify new file downloaded + upload file

✅ Dynamic Properties – buttons becoming visible/enabled after delay

✅ Assertions & Validation

Text validation

Visibility / clickability conditions

API status code assertions (via Chrome DevTools)

File existence validation in Downloads directory

✅ TestNG Integration

Organized test structure

Runnable test scenarios

Easy future expansion
